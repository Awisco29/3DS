# Module Purpose: Detect objects that may distract the driver while driving (especially cell phones).

# Purpose: To detect whether a cell phone is in use by the driver
# Pre-Conditions: A person and their hand  must be within the frame of the camera
# Post-Conditions: None
# Parameters: cell_phone_cascade
    # Cell_phone_cascade: an OpenCV classifier that will be trained to detect cell phones in the same fashion as the face and eye cascades. This is not a built in OpenCV classifier and will need to be trained manually.
# Return value: Boolean, is True if a cell phone is detected in a frame, and False otherwise.
